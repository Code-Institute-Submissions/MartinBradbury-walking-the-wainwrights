## Purpose of the project

The purpose of my website is to share my personal journey and experiences of walking all the Wainwrights in the Lake District. It's a digital diary where I document my routes, share images, and narrate my adventures. I aim to inspire and connect with fellow enthusiasts of the Lake District by providing a space for them to engage with my content, learn from my experiences, and perhaps even plan their own routes. Additionally, my website offers a unique opportunity for users to interact with me directly, either through contact forms or by leaving messages on my routes. This interactive feature fosters a sense of community among my visitors, encouraging them to share their own experiences, images, and stories of their walks in the Lake District. By creating a space where users can contribute their own content, my website not only serves as a personal blog but also as a collaborative platform for sharing and discovering the beauty and challenges of the Lake District together.
